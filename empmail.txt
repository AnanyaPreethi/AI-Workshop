Dear Bosses Boss,

My name is Ryan wicker and I am the head of the Marketing Department here at ABC Corp. I would like to lodge a formal grievance against John White, the Warehouse Supervisor and my immediate superior.

I have been employed at ABC for the last three years and I am proud to be a part of such a hard-working team in such an innovative company. Unfortunately, since the introduction of Mr. White in our department, my work has suffered due to chronic and severe demotivations in all our meetings.

Mr. White has used threats, insults and verbal intimidation on a routine basis at work. His behavior has extended to many people on the staff, although I speak only on behalf of myself. The treatment began on July, 2017, at a staff meeting. Mr. White repeatedly referred to my work as "impactless" and yelled at me once in the meeting room and then walked away venting anger. Since then I have documented multiple occurrences where he called me degrading and leading me into a psychological state where I no longer feel that my work is valuable. I also saved several emails where he takes blunt decisions without enquiring on that work done.

I believe that the entire staff has been affected by this atmosphere of negative and threatening behavior. I trust in your discretion and promptness in addressing and mediating this matter as soon as possible.
Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Ryan Wicker
